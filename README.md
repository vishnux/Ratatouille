# Recipe-Generation-using-GPT-2

This project involves fine-tuning a deep generative model, GPT-2, to construct five realistic recipes from a given inventory of ingredients. The goal is to generate new and exciting recipe ideas that utilize the provided ingredients.

## Dataset

[This is the dataset](https://eightportions.com/datasets/Recipes/#fn:1) used and it is collated by Ryan Lee, sourced from [Food Network](https://www.foodnetwork.com/), [Epicurious](https://www.epicurious.com/), and [Allrecipes](https://www.allrecipes.com/).

## Requirements:

* Python 3.x
* TensorFlow 2.x
* OpenAI GPT-2

## Getting Started:

1)Clone this repository\n
2)Install the required packages \n
3)Download the OpenAI GPT-2 model from huggingface

4)Run the notebooks and provide the list of ingredients

## Note:

This project is for educational purposes only.
The generated recipes may not always be perfect or entirely sensible. Please use your judgment before trying them out.
Feel free to modify the code and experiment with different ingredients to generate new recipes.

## Acknowledgments:
