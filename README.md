# Recipe-Generation-using-GPT-2

Fine-tuned a deep generative model to construct realistic recipes from an inventory of ingredients.

# Using Natural Language Processing to Generate New Recipes in Python

Welcome to this project! We will be finetuning a distilled version of GPT-2 on a smaller-scale dataset comprising recipes. The recipes are split into ingredients and instructions. Can we use GPT-2 to generate instructions from a list of instructions?

Prerequisites

- Intermediate-level knowledge of Python

- Basic UNIX/Bash skills for launching scripts

- A Google account (if you'd like to launch a finetuning instance on Google Colab)

- Basic knowledge of neural networks and deep learning (knowledge about large-scale models like BERT and GPT-2 will be preferred, but is not necessary)

- Some basic Natural Language Processing (NLP) experience will be beneficial
