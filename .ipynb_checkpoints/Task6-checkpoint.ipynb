       "[\" \\n Ingredients: \\n 1 1/2 pounds mussels, scrubbed and debearded \\n 1/2 cup dry vermouth, preferably Noilly Prat \\n 4 tablespoons (1/2 stick) unsalted butter \\n 2 medium shallots, thinly sliced \\n 3/4 pound white button mushrooms, ends trimmed, wiped clean and quartered \\n Kosher salt \\n 1/4 teaspoon red pepper flakes \\n 2 tablespoons blanched whole hazelnuts \\n Juice of 1 to 2 lemons, to taste \\n Grilled bread \\n Instructions: \\n Cook the mussels: Heat a skillet large enough to hold the mussels in a single layer over high heat for 1 minute. Remove from the heat and add the mussels and 1/4 cup of the vermouth. Return the skillet to the stove and cook for 1 minute. Add about 3/4 cup water. The mussels shouldn't take long to cook, about 2 minutes. Take care to stir the mussels from time to time so they cook as evenly as possible. Use tongs to pluck the mussels from the pan as they open. When all of the mussels are open, remove them and strain the liquid, reserving it for the sauce. Remove the mussels from their shells. Discard the shells. Cook the mushrooms: Rinse the skillet and return it to high heat until it smokes lightly. Remove the pan from the heat, add 1 tablespoon of the butter, and swirl the pan until the butter turns a light brown color. Return the skillet to the heat and immediately add the shallots and mushrooms. Season lightly with salt and the red pepper flakes. Cook the mushrooms until they start to give up liquid and brown, 3 to 4 minutes. Add the remaining 1/4 cup vermouth and cook for 1 minute. Season to taste with salt. Toast the hazelnuts: Meanwhile, in a small skillet, melt 1 tablespoon of the butter over medium heat and add the hazelnuts. Season them lightly with salt and toast them over low heat until they turn light brown, 5 to 7 minutes. Use a slotted spoon to remove the hazelnuts and transfer them to a cutting board. Roughly chop the hazelnuts. Make the sauce: Transfer the mushrooms to a plate using a slotted spoon. If there is any cooking liquid from the mushrooms, combine it with the mussel cooking liquid in a small saucepan. Simmer over low heat for 1 minute. The sauce may need a pinch of salt. The flavor should be an initial taste of sweet mussel followed by an undertone of earthiness from the mushroom. Swirl in 1 tablespoon of the butter and a touch of lemon juice. Keep warm. Assemble the dish: Heat a large skillet over high heat until hot, 2 minutes. Remove from the heat and add the remaining 1 tablespoon butter. When it turns light brown, return the skillet to the burner and add the mussels and mushrooms in a single layer. Cook for 1 minute without stirring them. They should be browned on their first side before you stir them slightly, with a wooden spoon, and leave them to brown for an additional minute. Stir in the sauce. Taste for seasoning. Toss in the hazelnuts. Serve immediately on a platter, family style, with slices of grilled bread. <|endoftext|> \",\n",

Add the shrimp, cover, and marinate in the refrigerator at least 20 minutes. Heat oil in deep-fryer or large wok to 375 degrees F. In a medium bowl, mix together all-purpose flour, ice water, cornstarch, egg yolk, salt, white sugar, and baking powder. One at a time, dip shrimp into the flour mixture to coat. Carefully place a few shrimp at a time in the hot oil and deep-fry until golden brown on all sides, about 1 1/2 minutes. Use a slotted spoon to remove the shrimp from the oil and drain on paper towels. Repeat with remaining shrimp. Tempura sauce: Stir together soy sauce, water, rice vinegar, and sugar until sugar is dissolved. Just before serving, stir in the scallions and serve immediately with the shrimp. <|endoftext|> ',\n",
       " \" \\n Ingredients: \\n Extra-virgin olive oil \\n 8 Ultimate Meatballs, recipe follows \\n 2 tablespoons kosher salt, plus more for seasoning \\n 1 tablespoon black peppercorns, plus freshly ground black pepper for seasoning \\n 2 tablespoons fennel seeds \\n 1 rack 8 pork spare ribs, cut into 2 to 3-rib pieces \\n 1 (2 pound) boneless pork shoulder, cut into 2 pieces (so it cooks at the same time as the ribs/meatballs) \\n 4 sprigs fresh thyme \\n 4 sprigs fresh oregano \\n 4 medium carrots, roughly chopped \\n 1 large onion, roughly chopped \\n 2 ribs celery, roughly chopped \\n 2 cups dry red wine \\n 3 (28-ounce) cans tomatoes (recommended: San Marzano) \\n 2 tablespoons tomato paste \\n 2 pounds spaghetti, cooked al dente in salted water \\n 1 cup roughly chopped raisins \\n 1 cup toasted pine nuts, roughly chopped \\n 1 cup roughly chopped flat-leaf parsley \\n Extra-virgin olive oil \\n 1 small to medium onion, chopped \\n 2 small garlic cloves, chopped \\n 1 1/2 tablespoons finely chopped fresh parsley leaves \\n 3 thick slices firm white bread, crust removed, cut into cubes (about 2 cups) \\n 3/4 cup milk \\n 1 1/2 pounds ground beef \\n 1 1/2 pounds ground pork \\n 1 large egg \\n 1/4 cup freshly grated Parmigiano-Reggiano, plus more for serving \\n Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper \\n Instructions: \\n Heat the oven to 350 degrees F. Set a large Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Add a 3-count of olive oil and gently brown the meatballs. Meanwhile, with a mortar and pestle, grind the salt, black peppercorns and fennel seeds with some olive oil into a grainy paste. Rub the ribs and shoulder with the mixture. Remove the meatballs with a slotted spoon and set aside on a paper towel-lined plate to drain. In the same pot, brown the shoulder pieces and ribs, in batches. Alternately to save time, roast the ribs in a preheated 500 degree F oven for 10 to 15 minutes while you brown the shoulder pieces in the pot. Remove the shoulder pieces and ribs to the meatball plate and let rest. Add a little more olive oil to the pot and add the thyme, oregano, carrots, onion and celery. Stir it around and scrape up the bits from the bottom of the pot with a wooden spoon. Cook the vegetables until they are slightly softened and have some nice color. Add the wine, tomatoes and tomato paste and mix well, scraping up any brown bits on the bottom. Nestle the pork shoulder pieces back into the middle of the pot then arrange the ribs around the sauce. Finish by placing the meatballs in the gaps (some of the pieces will be sticking out from the sauce but that's perfectly fine as it will roast and caramelize). Use a spoon to baste everything well, cover, then put the pot into the oven and roast until the pork is tender and the meat is just falling off the rib bones, about 1 to 1 1/2 hours. For the topping: Combine the chopped raisins, toasted pine nuts and parsley in a small bowl. Use a slotted spoon to remove the meatballs and ribs to a large platter. Remove the pork shoulder pieces from the pot and allow to rest for 10 minutes before slicing into bite-size pieces and adding them to the platter. Puree the sauce in a food processor then add it back to the pot and set over medium heat. Reduce the sauce until it is rich and thick, about 5 minutes. Season with salt and pepper, if needed. When the spaghetti is cooked, drain and add to a medium bowl. Spoon a little sauce over the spaghetti and the remaining sauce over the platter of meat. Garnish the meat platter with the raisin mixture and serve. Heat 3 tablespoons oil in an ovenproof skillet over medium heat. Add the onion, garlic, and parsley and cook until the vegetables are soft but not colored, about 10 minutes. Take the pan off the heat and let the mixture cool. Add the bread to a medium bowl and pour in the milk. Let the bread soak while the onions are cooling. Combine the meats in a large bowl. Add the egg and cheese and season generously with salt and pepper. Use your hands to squeeze the excess milk out of the bread and add it to the bowl along with the cooled onion mixture. Gently combine all the ingredients with your hands until just mixed together. Don't overwork the mixture or the meatballs will be tough. Divide the mixture into 8 equal pieces and shape them into 8 nice looking meatballs. Refrigerate until ready to cook. <|endoftext|> \",\n",
       " \" \\n Ingredients: \\n 3 pounds fatty boneless pork shoulder, cut into 2-inch chunks \\n Kosher salt \\n 2/3 cup vegetable oil or lard \\n 1 teaspoon dried Mexican oregano \\n Large pinch crushed red pepper \\n Small pinch ground cloves \\n 6 cloves garlic, thinly sliced \\n 3 bay leaves \\n Juice of 2 limes \\n Two 3-inch strips orange peel \\n 1/2 small white onion, finely chopped \\n Soft corn tortillas, for serving \\n Suggested toppings: sour cream, chopped fresh cilantro, pickled onions, chopped avocado and pico de gallo \\n Instructions: \\n Toss the pork with 2 teaspoons of salt. Transfer to a 6- to 7-quart Dutch oven or pot along with the oil, oregano, red pepper, cloves, garlic, bay leaves, lime juice, orange peel and onion. Cover with 4 to 5 cups of water. Bring to a high simmer, then reduce the heat to low, partially cover the pot and simmer gently, checking occasionally to give it a stir, until the pork is tender and just beginning to fall apart, about 1 hour and 30 minutes. Fish out the bay leaves and orange peel. (The pork will not look super-attractive at this point but don't panic!) Remove the lid and increase the heat to medium-high. Simmer vigorously, stirring frequently, until all of the water has evaporated, leaving only the oil, and the pork has browned and begun to fry slightly at the bottom of the pot; continue to cook, scraping up the bottom of the pot frequently to release the fried bits, 30 to 40 minutes. Use a slotted spoon to remove the pork from any remaining oil in the pot. Serve with tortillas and suggested toppings to make tacos. <|endoftext|> \",\n",
       " ' \\n Ingredients: \\n 1 Idaho baking potato, washed and dried \\n 2 pounds shrimp, fresh or frozen, in the shells \\n 2 1/2 quarts water \\n 1 lemon, cut into slices \\n 1 small bunch fresh parsley, washed \\n 16 black peppercorns \\n 4 bay leaves \\n 1 tablespoon kosher salt plus more for seasoning \\n Splash hot sauce (recommended: Tabasco) \\n 2 tablespoons good quality curry powder \\n 2 tablespoons warm water \\n 2 egg yolks \\n 1 teaspoon Dijon mustard \\n 1/2 lemon, juiced \\n Red wine vinegar \\n 1/2 to 3/4 cup olive oil \\n Instructions: \\n Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F. Place the potato inside to bake for 1 hour. Though these shrimp are served in the shell, run a small, sharp knife down the length of the shrimp to devein them. In a large saucepan, combine the water, lemon, parsley, peppercorns, bay leaves, salt, and hot sauce. Stir to blend and bring to a simmer. Remove from the heat and allow the liquid to cool for a few minutes. Add the shrimp and allow them to sit in the liquid, off the heat, until they are cooked in the middle, 3 to 5 minutes. Use a slotted spoon to remove the shrimp and drain them on a kitchen towel. Refrigerate until ready to serve. When the potato is tender (check by piercing with the tip of a knife), shut the oven off, remove the potato, and place it on a flat surface. Sprinkle the curry powder in a thin layer in an oven proof skillet and toast it in the oven (with the door open) until you smell the aroma of the curry, 2 minutes. Remove and set aside to cool. Split the potato in half lengthwise and scoop out the flesh. Transfer the flesh to a blender and add the warm water, egg yolks, mustard, and lemon juice. Pulse to blend. Add the curry powder and a splash of vinegar, if desired. With the blender running, pour a steady stream of the olive oil through the top, start with 1/2 cup and then taste. If needed, add more olive oil. Serve the sauce in a bowl on the side with the shrimp. <|endoftext|> ',\n",
       " ' \\n Ingredients: \\n 2 whole duck breasts \\n 1 1/2 pounds rendered duck, goose, or chicken fat (see Note) \\n 6 garlic cloves, peeled \\n 1 large shallot, peeled and coarsely chopped \\n 1 tablespoon kosher salt \\n 2 teaspoons freshly ground black pepper \\n 1 tablespoon dried herbes de Provence (see Note) \\n Instructions: \\n Place the duck breasts in the insert of a 5 1/2 to 6 quart slow cooker and add the fat, garlic, shallot, salt, pepper, and herbes de Provence. Cover, set the slow cooker on HIGH, and cook for 1 hour. Reduce the heat to LOW and cook until the duck is very, very tender--at least 4 and up to 8 hours. Use a slotted spoon to remove the duck from the fat, which can be strained, frozen, and reused. Serve the duck hot or at room temperature, or use it to make cassoulet. NOTE: You can buy canned goose fat in gourmet food stores. If you have not accumulated your own duck or goose fat, chicken fat is perfectly acceptable. There are three ways to get chicken fat for this recipe: You can skim congealed fat off the top of chicken soup or stock, buy it in a plastic tub from a kosher butcher, or make it yourself. To make your own, place raw chicken fat in a heavy saucepan and cook very slowly over medium-low heat until the fat has melted, the connective tissue has darkened and crisped, and any water has evaporated. Strain the rendered fat into a bowl. Rendered chicken fat can be kept in a sealed container in the freezer for up to 6 months. If you cannot find herbes de Provence, you can make your own by combining equal amounts of dried tarragon, rosemary, chervil, basil, and thyme leaves. <|endoftext|> ',\n",

For the dill pickle dressing: Stir together the diced pickles, pickle juice and sour cream in a small mixing bowl. Season with salt and pepper. For the fried tomatoes: Fill a large cast-iron pan with 1/2 inch of canola oil and set over medium-high heat. The oil is hot enough when you dip in a wooden spoon and small bubbles form around it. Place the eggs and cornmeal into separate shallow dishes. Sprinkle the eggs, cornmeal and sliced tomatoes with salt and pepper. In batches, dip both sides of the tomatoes in the eggs, and then dredge in the cornmeal. Shake off any excess coating. Fry the dredged tomatoes in the hot oil until golden brown on both sides, 3 to 4 minutes total. Use a slotted spoon to transfer the fried tomatoes to a paper towel-lined baking sheet or large plate. Repeat until all of the tomatoes have been dredged and fried. To assemble, divide the fried tomatoes among 4 large plates. Use a slotted spoon to remove the shrimp from the pickle juice liquid and place on the side of the tomatoes. Drizzle both the tomatoes and the shrimp with the dill pickle dressing. <|endoftext|> ',\n",
       " ' \\n Ingredients: \\n 2 1/2 cups finely-ground white or yellow cornmeal \\n 1/2 cup all-purpose flour \\n 1 tablespoon baking powder \\n 1 tablespoon ground black pepper \\n 1 1/2 teaspoons salt \\n 1 1/2 teaspoons sugar \\n 3/4 teaspoon baking soda \\n 1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper \\n 1 1/2 cups buttermilk \\n 3/4 cup chopped fresh scallions \\n 3 eggs, lightly beaten \\n Oil, for frying \\n Instructions: \\n In a medium bowl, mix the cornmeal, flour, baking powder, pepper, salt, sugar, baking soda and cayenne. In another bowl, gently mix the buttermilk, scallions and eggs. Whisk the wet and dry ingredients together until just combined, then rest the batter for 10 minutes. In a 6-quart stockpot, pour enough oil to fill the pan about a third of the way. Heat over medium heat until a deep-frying thermometer inserted in the oil reaches 350 to 360 degrees F. Drop small scoops or rounded tablespoons of the batter into the oil in batches of eight. As soon as the hush puppies start to float, use tongs to rotate and cook until both sides are crisp and light golden brown, 60 to 90 seconds. It helps to put a pasta strainer on top of the hush puppies at this point to keep them submerged. Use a slotted spoon to remove the hush puppies, and transfer to a clean brown paper bag to remove excess grease. Repeat for the remaining batter, about 24 hush puppies total. Serve the hush puppies steaming hot. <|endoftext|> ',\n",

Pull the leaves off the rosemary and thyme sprigs. Throw the crushed peppercorns into a bowl with the salt and herb leaves and add the minced garlic. Use your fingers to toss it all together, then set it aside. Place the beef, fat-side up, on a rack in a roasting pan. Drizzle the olive oil all over the surface and rub it in with your hands. Sprinkle the peppercorn-herb-salt mixture all over the surface of the beef, pressing it lightly with your hands. Roast the beef 45 minutes for the first stage. Reduce the oven temperature to 300 degrees F and insert a meat thermometer sideways into the roast. Roast the beef an additional 1 hour 15 minutes to 1 hour 30 minutes, or until the thermometer registers 120 degrees F to 135 degrees F in the center for medium rare. (The meat will continue to cook for a bit after you remove it from the oven.) Remove the beef from the rack and let it rest about 15 minutes to allow the juices to redistribute throughout the meat. When you\\'re ready to serve, carve it into slices of your preferred width. Make the batter before removing the prime rib from the oven: Combine the eggs and half-and-half in a bowl and whisk until they\\'re totally combined. Throw the flour and 2 teaspoons salt into a sifter and sift them straight into the bowl. Whisk until it\\'s nice and smooth, then refrigerate until the prime rib is ready. After the beef is removed from the pan, increase the oven temperature to 450 degrees F. Use a slotted spoon to remove the peppercorns, herbs and excess salt from the drippings. Pour the remaining drippings into a separate container. They should be speckled and lovely! Pour a small amount (about 1/2 teaspoon or so) of the drippings into each cup of a standard muffin pan and place the pan in the hot oven for a couple of minutes, or until just before the drippings begin to smoke. Carefully remove the pan from the oven and immediately fill the muffin cups about 1/2 to 2/3 full. Bake 13 to 14 minutes, or until they\\'ve \"popped\" about as much as they can pop. Serve them in a basket with a pretty napkin right next to the prime rib. Photograph by Con Poulos <|endoftext|> ',\n",

       " ' \\n Ingredients: \\n 2 1/4 cups of your favorite all-purpose baking mix, such as Bisquick \\n About 1/3 cup buttermilk, plus more for brushing \\n About 1/3 cup milk \\n 2 jalapenos \\n 1/4 cup heavy cream \\n 8 large eggs \\n Kosher salt and freshly ground pepper \\n 3 tablespoons canola oil \\n 8 ounces breakfast sausage \\n 1 small yellow onion, small dice (about 1 cup) \\n 1 cup shredded sharp Cheddar cheese \\n 1 large green tomato, quartered lengthwise and thinly sliced \\n Instructions: \\n Position an oven rack in the top third of the oven and preheat to 450 degrees F. Prepare the biscuits according to the package directions, replacing half of the milk with buttermilk (this will amount to about 1/3 cup milk and 1/3 cup buttermilk for most mixes). Roll or pat the dough into an approximately 8-inch round about 1/2 inch thick. Use a 2-inch round biscuit cutter to cut biscuits out of the dough. You can reroll the scraps once and cut additional biscuits, making 14 to 16 biscuits total. Transfer the cut biscuits onto an ungreased baking sheet and brush lightly with the remaining buttermilk. Bake until the tops are golden brown, 6 to 8 minutes. Allow to sit at room temperature while you prepare the eggs. Change the oven setting to broil. Put the jalapenos on a small baking sheet and place under the broiler until charred all over, turning the jalapenos as needed, about 5 minutes. Transfer to a small bowl and cover with plastic wrap. Let sit for 5 minutes, and then peel the skin away from the jalapenos. Roughly chop into small pieces, removing the seeds if you do not want the eggs too spicy. Set aside. Whisk the cream, eggs and some salt and pepper together in a large bowl. Heat the canola oil in a 10-inch nonstick ovenproof saute pan over medium-high heat. Add the breakfast sausage and cook until browned, breaking up the meat with a wooden spoon, 4 to 6 minutes. Use a slotted spoon to remove the browned meat to a plate. Reduce the heat to medium, add the onions and cook until lightly caramelized, 4 to 6 minutes. Add the chopped jalapenos and browned sausage back to the pan and stir to combine. Pour the egg mixture into the pan and cook until the eggs just start to set, about 2 minutes. Sprinkle with the cheese and continue to cook until the frittata is almost set but the top is still runny, about 3 minutes. Place the frittata under the broiler and broil until lightly puffed and the top is golden brown, about 3 minutes. Let stand for 5 minutes. Meanwhile, turn off the broiler and place the biscuits back in the oven. The residual heat of the oven will warm the biscuits through. After 5 minutes, use a rubber spatula to loosen the frittata from the pan and invert it onto a cutting board. Cut into 14 to 16 pieces (depending on how many biscuits you baked). Split open the warm biscuits and sandwich a piece of frittata and some sliced green tomato between each biscuit. <|endoftext|> ',\n",

Carefully remove the pan from the oven and immediately fill the muffin cups about 1/2 to 2/3 full. Bake 13 to 14 minutes, or until they\\'ve \"popped\" about as much as they can pop. Serve them in a basket with a pretty napkin right next to the prime rib. Move the oven rack to the bottom and preheat the oven to 500 degrees F, then start with the seasoning: Grab the peppercorns and throw them in a big plastic bag and pound them with a rolling pin to break them open. Pull the leaves off the rosemary and thyme sprigs. Throw the crushed peppercorns into a bowl with the salt and herb leaves and add the minced garlic. Use your fingers to toss it all together, then set it aside. Place the beef, fat-side up, on a rack in a roasting pan. Drizzle the olive oil all over the surface and rub it in with your hands. Sprinkle the peppercorn-herb-salt mixture all over the surface of the beef, pressing it lightly with your hands. Roast the beef 45 minutes for the first stage. Reduce the oven temperature to 300 degrees F and insert a meat thermometer sideways into the roast. Roast the beef an additional 1 hour 15 minutes to 1 hour 30 minutes, or until the thermometer registers 120 degrees F to 135 degrees F in the center for medium rare. (The meat will continue to cook for a bit after you remove it from the oven.) Remove the beef from the rack and let it rest about 15 minutes to allow the juices to redistribute throughout the meat. When you\\'re ready to serve, carve it into slices of your preferred width. Photograph by Con Poulos <|endoftext|> ',\n",
       " ' \\n Ingredients: \\n 1 whole chicken \\n Salt and freshly ground black pepper \\n 1/2 orange, halved \\n 6 cloves garlic \\n 1/2 onion, halved \\n 1 stalk celery, chopped \\n 2 sprigs fresh rosemary \\n 2 sprigs fresh thyme \\n Salt \\n 3 cups snow or snap peas \\n 4 carrots, peeled and cut on a bias 1/2-inch thick \\n 1 tablespoon grated fresh ginger \\n 2 teaspoons plus 2 tablespoons butter, divided \\n 1 tablespoon brown sugar \\n 2 tablespoons grated fresh garlic \\n Freshly ground black pepper \\n 2 cups chicken stock \\n 1/2 cup soy sauce \\n 1 tablespoon anise seed \\n 1 tablespoon honey \\n 1 tablespoon rice wine vinegar \\n 1 tablespoon sesame oil \\n 2 sprigs fresh thyme \\n Instructions: \\n For the chicken: Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Clean the chicken and sprinkle the entire bird, inside and out, with salt and pepper. Stuff the bird with the oranges, garlic, onions, celery, rosemary and thyme. Place the chicken on a rack in a roasting pan and bake for 20 minutes. If the chicken is browning too quickly, turn the oven down to 375 degrees F and cook until the internal temperature of the chicken is 165 degrees, about 1 hour 20 minutes. Remove the chicken from the oven, tent with foil and let rest 30 minutes. While the chicken is cooking, work on the garnishes. For the snow peas and carrots: Fill a large pot with water, season with salt and bring to a boil. Prepare an ice bath by placing ice cubes and water in a bowl. Set aside. Dump the snap peas into the boiling water and cook until al dente. Be sure to test the peas as they are cooking to prevent them from overcooking. Use a slotted spoon to remove the snow peas from the water and plunge into the ice bath. Remove from the ice when cool and reserve until service. Put the carrots, ginger, 1 teaspoon salt, 2 teaspoons butter and brown sugar in a saute pan and add water until the carrots are barely covered. The carrots should be in a single layer. Put on high heat and cook until all the water is nearly evaporated. Cover and set aside for service. For the star anise sauce: Combine the stock, soy sauce, anise seeds, honey, vinegar, sesame oil and thyme and reduce until the sauce coats the back of a spoon. Once the chicken has rested, carve the bird by removing the legs from the thighs and slicing the breasts in half. Pour any juices that have collected in the pan into the sauce and hold warm over low heat. To finish the snap peas, heat a saute pan over medium heat and add 1 tablespoon butter. Once it is bubbly, add the garlic and snap peas. Season with salt and pepper. To finish the carrots, gently reheat over medium heat and add the remaining 1 tablespoon butter to moisten. Once everything is hot, serve a piece of white and dark meat garnished with the carrots, snap peas and drizzled with the sauce. <|endoftext|> ',\n",
       " ' \\n Ingredients: \\n 1 tablespoon olive oil, plus more \\n 3 fresh Mexican chorizo sausages, casings removed (about 1 pound) \\n Four 10-inch flour tortillas \\n 2 cups grated Pepper Jack cheese (about 8 ounces) \\n One 15-ounce can black beans, drained and rinsed \\n Easy Homemade Salsa, recipe follows \\n 1 tablespoon butter \\n Sour cream, for serving \\n 1/2 cup fresh cilantro leaves \\n 4 plum tomatoes, cut into quarters, seeds removed \\n 1 clove garlic, smashed and peeled \\n 1 jalapeno, seeds removed, quartered \\n Juice of 1 lime \\n 1/4 red onion, cut into chunks \\n Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper \\n Instructions: \\n Watch how to make this recipe. Add some oil to the skillet over medium heat. Once hot add the sausage and cook, stirring and breaking up the meat with a wooden spoon, until cooked through and crumbly, about 7 minutes. Use a slotted spoon to remove the sausage from the pan to a paper-towel-lined sheet tray to drain off some of the grease. To assemble the quesadillas, sprinkle each tortilla with 1/2 cup sausage, 1/2 cup cheese, some beans and Easy Homemade Salsa. Fold the tortilla over to close. Heat a cast-iron double-burner griddle over medium-high heat. Add the butter and 1 tablespoon oil. Once the butter is melted and foamy, carefully add the quesadillas to the pan and cook on both sides until golden brown and cheese is fully melted, about 4 minutes per side. Serve with sour cream. Add the cilantro, tomatoes, garlic, jalapenos, lime juice, onion and some salt and pepper to the bowl of a food processor, and pulse until blended together. You want the salsa to still maintain some texture but be much smoother than if chopping by hand. <|endoftext|> ',\n",
       " ' \\n Ingredients: \\n 1 cup mayonnaise \\n 2 tablespoons chopped fresh chives \\n 2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley \\n 1 tablespoon finely chopped cornichons \\n 2 teaspoons capers, roughly chopped \\n 1 lemon, juiced \\n 3/4 cup rice flour \\n 1/2 cup all-purpose flour \\n 1/2 teaspoon baking powder \\n 1/4 teaspoon salt, plus more as needed \\n 3/4 to 1 cup club soda \\n 8 cups vegetable oil \\n Two 6-ounce fillets white fish \\n 2 cups French fries, hot \\n Lemon wedges, for serving \\n Instructions: \\n For the sauce: In a small bowl combine the mayonnaise, chives, parsley, cornichons, capers and lemon juice. Mix until smooth and taste for seasoning; adjust the flavors if needed. Transfer to a small ramekin. For the fish and chips: Combine the rice flour, all-purpose flour, baking powder and salt, and whisk in enough of the club soda to reach the consistency of a thick batter. Pour the oil in a large saucepot set over medium-high heat, and heat until a deep-frying thermometer inserted in the oil reaches 350 degrees F. Dip a piece of the fish into the batter, and then slowly lower into the hot oil. Repeat with the second piece of fish. Cook until golden brown and flaky, 4 to 6 minutes. Use a slotted spoon to remove the fish, and place on a paper-towel-lined plate to absorb any excess oil. Season with salt immediately, and then transfer to serving plates. Serve the fish with the tartar sauce, French fries and lemon wedges. <|endoftext|> ']"
